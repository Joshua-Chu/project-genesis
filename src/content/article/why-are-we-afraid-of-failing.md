Failing and being a failure are two completely different things. Failing is when you try and not succeed, but being a failure is when you stop trying.

[Give examples of how]

From the moment we were born

Students often get discouraged to participate in class because of failing and not because they’re a failure. In our classrooms, being smart or being the smartest is heavily associated with being successful, and to those students who are not as smart; they label themselves as failures, if not by others.

This greatly affects how they perceive themselves, resulting in more discouragement from both internal and external influences. A vicious cycle that will always continue to linger as long as we continue to believe that the path to failure is always led by failing, and the path to success is a road where failing does not exist.

The belief system of failing that we have, which is built upon the experiences we’ve collected throughout our life, somehow ended up treating it as an absolute truth that cannot be refuted or changed.

The way we frame the idea of what success is, to say the least, is suffocating. It leaves only a sliver of opportunity for us to embrace failing. It is as if the world is just black and white, 1’s and 0’s, success or failure.

Yet, in between these two points are a plethora of crossroads.

And although all roads lead us back to either the one or the other, what matters most are the things that we learned, the friendships we formed and the actions we take.

We only truly become failures if we fail to try, to change, and to realize that failing gives meaning and beauty to success.
